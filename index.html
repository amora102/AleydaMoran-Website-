        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology ðŸŒŽ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first generation college student at UC Riverside. I was born in El Salvador and I have had to overcome multiple obstacles to adapt to a new country. I come from a single parent household where my mom had to raise both my brother and I on her own. She was born here, but still does not speak the language. I had to figure out school related things on my own because she was unable to help me. This allows me to adapt to my environment quickly and familiarize myself with my surroundings in order to function to the best of my ability. This also means that I am bilingual and speak both Spanish and English. I have had multiple obstacles in my life which have allowed me to become a more responsible person and independent. My family currently resides in the city of Inglewood and living there was definitely a struggle within itself. I believe that growing up in a rough neighborhood has made me a stronger person and forced me to mature quicker. By being in college I have broken multiple stereotypes and exceeded people's expectations. Nobody expects for a latina girl from Inglewood to receive higher education, however I have decided to take the route people don't expect me to.<br><br>

       My major is Sociology because my goal is to make a difference in the foster care system. I want to be a social worker and hopefully climb my way up and go to Graduate school, so I can actually have the power to change foster kids lives for the better. My goal has always been to help people struggling with mental health issues and/or disruptive home lives. I truly believe that it all starts at home, so if a child grows up in a dysfunctional house it affects their life success. I want to be the person I wish I had growing up for other people. I do not have work experience. This is because my mother always wanted me to strictly focus on school and not lose focus. However, I was in multiple cultural clubs in highschool and was extremely involved. This helped me gain leadership skills and I was able to learn a lot of different things. I have become very socially and culturally aware and I can always bring this with me into a working environment to be respectful of all my peers.<br><br>

        As a sophomore I have room to grow as a college student and gain even more experience. As of right now I do not have much, but I can say I am passionate and driven. I know how to efficiently communicate and I know I can contribute to a productive and respectful working environment if given the chance. I have really good interpersonal skills because I was always put into new environments where I was forced to make new friends. Some might think that my young age and lack of experience is a disadvantage. However, I do not believe it is. I am eager to learn and extremely open minded that I know I can succeed under any position. I am ready to learn and tackle any task with perseverance.
